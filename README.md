Speakspear AI Chatbot

This project is an educational implementation of a custom GPT prototype, the Speakspear AI Chatbot, designed to generate Shakespearean-style text. The chatbot is built using PyTorch, with a Bigram Model and a simplified GPT model based on Transformer architecture. This project was created solely for learning purposes and is not intended for commercial use.
Project Overview

    Model Type: Bigram Model with Transformer Architecture
    Framework: PyTorch
    Training Data: Shakespeareâ€™s writings (sample text in input_data.txt)
    Objective: To build a text generation model that mimics Shakespearean dialogue.

Features

    Bigram Language Model: A simple model with 1M parameters leveraging a Transformer architecture to generate text outputs.
    Frequency and Positional Encoding: Text data is preprocessed with frequency encoding and positional encoding to aid context understanding.
    Self-Attention Mechanism: Uses multi-head self-attention blocks to capture relationships between words in a sequence, enhancing context comprehension.

Files

    bigram_model.py: Contains the implementation of the Bigram language model, including training and text generation functions.
    gpt_model.py: Implements a simplified GPT model using Transformer blocks, with multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward layers.
    input_data.txt: Sample text data (excerpts from Shakespeare) used to train the model.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    PyTorch
    Additional libraries: torch, torch.nn, torch.optim

Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/speakspear-ai-chatbot.git
cd speakspear-ai-chatbot

Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the Model:
        To train the Bigram model, execute bigram_model.py.
        To train the GPT model, execute gpt_model.py.

    Generate Text:
        Use the generate() method in either BigramLanguageModel or GPTLanguageModel to create Shakespearean-style text samples.
